# tierator

This is my first ever Vue.js project! Woo!

It's a tier generator. Just for funsies.

This isn't live to its domain on the web yet, as I need to redo the file structure to accomodate for Nuxt.js.

## Future Updates:

- tiers should be exportable as an image
- browse page needs finished
- home page needs redone
- various styling updates are needed
- mobile functionality
